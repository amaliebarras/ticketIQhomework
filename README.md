## Research

### SWOT of Existing Design

#### Strengths
* Call to action buttons are contrasting and obvious
* Colors do feel sporty
* Typography is good

#### Weaknesses
* Welcome copy is a little confusing / hard-selly
* Not sure how I should browse
* Don't find out why I should get the app until after the scroll
* Search is boxed off, not prominent
* Hard to tell what type of event at first glance
* Not sure what to expect under "other" (tennis is a sport)
    * Hierarchy issue - may be out of scope

#### Opportunities
* Search should be in mid-center above the fold
* Soften explanation to sound more like service
* Show all search options (calendar, city)
* Clarify ideal experience (is it the app?)
* Illustrate / color code event types? 
* Leverage colors and type in the redesign
 
#### Threats
* Niche event ticket sites (music events only, sports only)
* Competitors with more modern UI
* Stronger brands (stubhub, etc)

### UserTesting

#### Test 1:

##### Hypothesis -  
Users are not sure what differentiates ticketIQ from competitors.

##### Test - 
Go to www.ticketiq.com, stay on this page for 10 seconds. Now, tell me what this site does.

* User felt overwhelmed by the use of color
* User guessed ticketIQ was a place to connect you with places to buy tickets, because of the tagline "the smartest ticket search", but felt unsure, it could be explained better
* User felt confused about the app "nobody should need an app to do this

********

#### Test 2: 

##### Hypothesis -  
Search isn't the first thing that the user feels like they're supposed to do.

##### Test - 
Your friend is coming to visit you in Dallas and loves hockey. Find tickets to a hockey Game that you could go to.

* User did use search right away, but it didn't load 
* Would have used middle browse but it was covered up by search autocomplete
* Went to global nav

********

#### Test 3: 

##### Hypothesis -  
Event type hierarchy is a little bit confusing.

##### Test - 
Close the window. Can I find tickets to:

* Hamilton? 
    * User guessed yes
* An f1 race?
    * "I don't think so"
* A tennis match?
    * "Yes"
    * Expected it to be under sports, not "other"

### Core Purpose of Page
Communicate to customers what they can do on this site, which is search multiple databases for tickets to many types of events.

#### Other Purposes

* Welcome customers.
* Build trust. 
* Highlight what we do (Ticket Search)

### Redesign Goals

#### Eliminate these Feelings
Overwhelmed
Uncertain
Confused
Impatient
Misguided
Uneasy

#### Create these Instead
Calmed
Trusting
Certain
Patient
Directed
At ease

### Approach

#### TicketIQ is the smartest search, so make the user feel smart about using it 
* Arm the user with knowledge about what the site is
* Make calls to action super obvious
* Explain value of microconversions 
    * Register
    * Signin
    * Download app
